        image: images/raw-forecast-data.png
        content: Over 100m rows of COVID-19 Forecast Hub data follow <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/data-processed/README.md#forecast-file-format" target="_blank">a data model for probabilistic forecasts specified by quantiles</a>. These data are stored publicly in <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">a structured data storage repository</a> on GitHub. They can also be downloaded programmatically from our <a href="https://zoltardata.com/project/44" target="_blank">Zoltar API</a>.

        content: <a href="http://reichlab.io/" target="_blank">Our team</a> has been developing open-source software for years to assist with forecast modeling in outbreak response. We have developed the <a href="https://reichlab.io/d3-foresight/" target="_blank">d3-foresight javascript library</a> for visualization and the <a href="https://zoltardata.com/" target="_blank">Zoltar system for forecast storage</a>. We also have developed the <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covidHubUtils" target="_blank">covidHubUtils</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covidData" target="_blank">covidData</a> packages as resources for accessing data for and about forecast models.
