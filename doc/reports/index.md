We follow a weekly update cycle at the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Every Tuesday morning, our team assembles the most recent forecasts from all teams that have submitted in the last week. We use these data to generate an <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/doc/ensemble/" target="_blank">ensemble forecast</a> that synthesizes predictions of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths from all eligible models. These forecasts are then reviewed, analyzed, and verified by our collaborators at the US CDC. On Wednesday, the CDC updates their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html" target="_blank">COVID-19 Forecasting webpage</a> with the latest data from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.

## Forecast Summaries
Each week, we also generate a weekly report that provides some top-level summary numbers from the ensemble forecast. These reports summarize the number of expected deaths for the following four weeks in the United States on a national and state level. Please click on a link below to see the report for that week.
